<p class="description">
  As the name of the project implies the purpose of this is to
  conduct a forensic investigation into 'Noise Storms' and in particular the LOVE Noise Storm that was first reported
  by GreyNoise in August 2024 as part of their StormWatch podcast 
  <a href="https://www.greynoise.io/storm-watch-episodes/andrew-morris-on-noise-storms-uncovering-a-hidden-message-in-millions-of-icmp-packets">https://www.greynoise.io/storm-watch-episodes/andrew-morris-on-noise-storms-uncovering-a-hidden-message-in-millions-of-icmp-packets.</a>
<p>
  During the course of my forensic analysis of this phenomenon I have produced a detection script to be ran on packet captures
  to discover if there is any presense of these "LOVE" packets as well as a modified version of the program believed to be
  responsible for these packets and a parser for parsing packet captures and fixing the data capture to be readable by reversing
  the measures taken to hide the capture in the first place such as the modifying of the send timestamp on the program to hide it
  from dissectors when being viewed.
